# Web Development

I am a programmer by vocation. One field I've been drawn to for years is web development. As a youth, I had motivational issues, so I have not been as diligent as I could have been. Nevertheless, to this day, I've designed and maintained several small websites. You are on one. This page documents several others.

Professionally, my job title is Programmer 1 at [The City of Prince George](http://princegeorge.ca). My primary focus is developing Microsoft SharePoint.

[The Green Place](http://thegreenplace.ca) is my father's business. In addition to hosting his website, I also host an email account of his.

[Western Record Management & Storage Inc.](http://westernrecord.com) is one of my most recent jobs. The client was hacked through an insecure Joomla installation. I recovered much of the content from the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web), rewrote the front-page text, wrote the back-end code that is now powering this site, and redesigned the layout in four hours.

[Hopes And Dreams Child Care](http://hopesanddreamschildcare.ca) is my aunt and cousin's business. It is a straight-forward one page website.

[baryon.ca](baryon.ca) is a site I use to promote my DJ alterego, baryon.
