# #GamerGate material

I am very passionate about the ongoing journalistic corruption expos√© and consequent ethics discussion known by the hashtag #GamerGate. Here are some good resources:

## Information-oriented
* [The #GamerGate press dossier][dossier] is the most comprehensive #GamerGate related resource. It covers all the journalistic breaches of ethics that led to the current state of #GamerGate.
* [GamerGate.me][ggme], by Moltar aka Moldybars, is a central point of dissemination for all kinds of #GamerGate info.
* [A People's History of GamerGate](http://www.historyofgamergate.com/), a site I haven't vetted as much as the rest of this, but is generally well-regarded.

## Communities
* [The #GamerGate 8chan board][8chan] is the best place for discussion of #GamerGate.
* [The KotakuInAction subreddit][plebbit] is another good place for discussion of #GamerGate.

## Individuals
* [cainejw][caine] writes articles on #GamerGate that I can agree with wholeheartedly.
* [The Ralph Retort][ralph] writes many controversial blog entries on #GamerGate. I don't always agree with him, but there are few happenings that he doesn't comment on, so he's great for completionists.
* [Sargon of Akkad](https://www.youtube.com/user/SargonofAkkad100), a YouTube personality with a remarkable capacity for seeing through nonsense.

## David Pakman Show
David Pakman is a progressive journalist who did around a dozen interviews with various #GamerGate personalities. The quality varies, and as the series goes on, he tries hard to inject his own views into the discussion. There are several interviews that are definite "must-watch" material in my eyes.

* [Milo Yiannopoulos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljIMMCQyexA), a writer for [breitbart.com](http://breitbart.com). A thoroughly-engaging journalist who has covered most of the initial #GamerGate media corruption in detail.
* [totalbiscuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaMccosnRMc) aka The Cynical Brit aka John Bain, a renowned YouTube personality.
* [Liana Kerzner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OflBPs49vok), a Canadian writer and occasional games journalist who has interacted with many of the individuals implicated in corruption through #GamerGate
