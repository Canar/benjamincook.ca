This is the Internet residence of Benjamin Cook. If he bothered with social media any more, this would be his profile page. Walled gardens suck. Long live the Free Web.

I've been involved in the local electronic music scene for a long time, DJing, VJing, producing, promoting, and so on. I chose the alias baryon and host a decent selection of mixes at [baryon.ca](http://baryon.ca)
