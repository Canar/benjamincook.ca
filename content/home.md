# Benjamin Cook, B. Sc.

This is the Internet residence of Benjamin Cook. If he bothered with social media any more, this would be his profile page. Walled gardens suck. Long live the Free Web.

I've been involved in the local electronic music scene for a long time, DJing, VJing, producing, promoting, and so on. I chose the alias baryon and host a decent selection of mixes at [baryon.ca](http://baryon.ca)

## What I've been up to

### December 22, 2014

I've fallen off the map lately to focus on my DJ software. While deep in hack mode, I got mind-jacked by a scandal involving breaches of ethics in journalism discussed on Twitter as the hashtag [#GamerGate](gamergate).

I have overhauled this page, at least on the back-end. Instead of PHP (ugh) I have switched to a Makefile-driven static HTML back-end that uses Markdown-flavoured content files. Modify what I want on my server, issue the command "make", and watch the monkeys dance.

The backend was developed pronto for a quick job for [Western Record](http://westernrecord.com) I was referred by my friend Liam. In four hours, I had reconstructed a site from a few old archive.org images and developed a new static back-end at the same time.

Next up is baryon.ca. Poor site still thinks I'm in university. What with my new OVH dedi, I can finally host a comprehensive archive of every mix I've made. Hooray!
