# Ethical guidelines

I hold myself to a high ethical standard, at least ideally. The Human Resources department at my work has told me that I am a man of contradictions because of my creative nature, and that I should embrace that. So, here are my guidelines, so I can breach them later on.

I aim for positivity. The only valid purpose of criticism, in my view, is when it is being used to highlight an alternative solution that has a better outcome than the object of criticism. Consequently, I view philosophies like those underpinning [Critical Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/Critical_theory) to be repugnant. Moreover, Critical Theory aims to be a general critical methodology. Again, I strongly disagree with it on a theoretical basis. Critique should be the domain of the experts in a specific field of knowledge.

Then again, this is why sociologists and the like correlate with lower IQ than the STEM-focused academic master race.
