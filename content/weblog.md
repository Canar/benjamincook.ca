<p>I've fallen off the map lately to focus on my DJ software. While deep in hack mode, I got mind-jacked by a scandal involving breaches of ethics in journalism discussed on Twitter as the hashtag <a href="gamergate">#GamerGate</a>.</p>

<p>I have overhauled this page, at least on the back-end. Instead of PHP (ugh) I have switched to a Makefile-driven static HTML back-end that uses Markdown-flavoured content files. Modify what I want on my server, issue the command "make", and watch the monkeys dance.</p>

<p>The backend was developed pronto for a quick job for <a href="http://westernrecord.com">Western Record</a> I was referred by my friend Liam. In four hours, I had reconstructed a site from a few old archive.org images and developed a new static back-end at the same time.</p>

<p>Next up is baryon.ca. Poor site still thinks I'm in university. What with my new OVH dedi, I can finally host a comprehensive archive of every mix I've made. Hooray!</p>
