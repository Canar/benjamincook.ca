# How to contact me

## Email

The easiest way to get a hold of me is email. Any email address that ends with `@benjamincook.ca` gets through, mostly. You'll get a bounceback if you choose something bad. The instant I actually list an email address here, it gets spammed, so I've stopped doing it. For example, `stupid@benjamincook.ca` would work but that's one of the addresses I've had to blocklist due to spam. The joke email I used to suggest, `ilostmyvirginity@benjamincook.ca` has also been blacklisted because of spam.

## Cellular

For now, I can be reached over the cell network at `+12509818221`. This is liable to change, at which point I'll provide a Skype account or something. There aren't many good free video chat software packages.

## Internets

I am, as I often say, a child of the Internet. My eldest account, at present, is my [Hydrogenaudio](http://hydrogenaud.io) account, where I am the moderator Canar.

I am usually accessible on the Freenode IRC server also under the alias Canar. Due to privacy concerns near the outset of [#GamerGate](gamergate), I deleted a couple other Canar accounts I had on Last.FM, DeviantArt, and Twitter. Oh well.
