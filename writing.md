# Compiled Musings

I greatly enjoy writing. Translating thoughts into language verges on magic to me. I have written since my youth; I remember writing my first short stories in Grade 3. I've never really stopped, though the urge seeps out in various directions depending on what else is going on in my life. I have intermittently blogged since the age of 15. I have a massive database from my old Wordpress installation that moves from server to server with me. This page will contain a select few writings I've found to still be salient today.

Presently available:

 * A [compilation of links regarding #GamerGate.](gamergate)
 * A [General ethical guidelines for my writing.](ethics)
